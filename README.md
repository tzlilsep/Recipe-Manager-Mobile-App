# Recipe Manager Mobile App

Developed an end-to-end mobile application with a React Native client and a Node.js backend, written in TypeScript.

- Implemented RESTful APIs with a clean, feature-based, modular architecture.

- Deployed the backend on AWS EC2 with a PostgreSQL database and AWS Cognito for user authentication.

- Built core features including a personal recipe book, recipe discovery, meal planning, and shared shopping lists.

- Enabled seamless recipe entry and reading with images, unit and quantity conversion, and direct export of recipes or meals to shopping lists.

- Supported real-world collaboration by allowing users to share shopping lists and exchange recipes with other users.
